  content: >
    We come on-site and empower your people to use AI.


    Don't know where to begin with AI? We can help your team learn enough that they can start building tools to solve the problems they face in their own work.


    Our Process:


    1. We interview key team members & produce a comprehensive report

    2. We run education days which help people use the technology in their daily work

    3. We follow up with your team regularly to see what questions they have

    
    We offer full-spectrum AI training from basics to advanced competency. We'll run your team through exercises that give them hands-on experience, with practical business applications.
    

    Our education is based on real-world use cases in data extraction, analysis, and reporting.


    We also, after our initial investigation, layer in custom-tailored examples for your team.


    We teach people enough to solve their own problems - and build their own tools - so they can be set free to reinvent their work.


    And finally, we offer regular follow-up sessions to ensure continued success.
