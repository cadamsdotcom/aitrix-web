title: The AI Trix Philosophy
subtitle: How we do this consulting thing.
layout: philosophy
draft: false
items:
- title: Targeted
  body: We do targeted projects with defined returns. We start with an initial investigation and report on how things are and how we can help.

- title: Careful and deliberate
  body: Go carefully and incrementally. Move deliberately, break nothing.

- title: Add value
  body: It has to be helpful. We care about helping people get the benefits of this tech.

- title: Outcomes, not technology.
  body: Sure - we use cool technology to do what we do. But ultimately, what matters is improving your business and work, so you can save time, costs, and scale.

- title: Not a "transformation"
  body: Add a bit at a time. Keep shaping until it starts to work well. Do not replace anything in any hurry. Apply this to processes, tools, and changes in how people work.

- title: Supercharge people. Don't make them redundant
  body: We believe in replacing _job roles, not people_. We give your expert people more time so they can do _more work_, do _more valuable work_, or **both**.

- title: Have an escape plan
  body: Not all changes go well. Have a backup and a rollback plan in case things don't work out or there's an emergency. Never fully move to new tech until it's proven itself in _all_ scenarios.

- title: Use tools you already have
  body: Your work is already complex. We try not to make you learn new tools, though it's not always possible.

- title: Human oversight of AI
  body: Anything customer-facing, or anything irreversible, must be inspected before being carried out. We include human inspection steps in every automation.

- title: Focus
  body: Work on one project at a time for you until delivery.

- title: Scope
  body: Defined projects with high impact on a function, process, or team's work.
